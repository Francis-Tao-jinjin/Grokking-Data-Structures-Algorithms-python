# Operations on Doubly Linked List

In a Doubly Linked List (DLL) each node contains a data field, a reference to the next node in the sequence (next), and a reference to the preceding node in the sequence (prev). The operations we are going to discuss are:

1. Insert: Adds a new node to the list. It can be at the beginning, end, or any specific position.
2. Insert After: Adds a new node after a specified node.
3. Delete: Removes a node with the specified data from the list.
4. Search: Searches for a node with the specified data in the list and returns true if found, otherwise false.
